# IMDB Score Visualizer
 This project provides you with IMDb scores in the appropriate format and colors.

-The api.ipynb file is used to run the server and link index.html to get.py.

-The get.py file retrieves scores from the IMDB using the Selenium library and keeps them in a list type.

-index.html visualizes data.


If you are confused about how the script works, just run api.ipynb and go to the localhost in the output and type the TV series or movie you want into the search box.

Be careful that you may need to change the path of some files as they specify a local location.

If you still have problems despite the instructions, please contact me. (My linkedn adress:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunusdermencioglu/")
